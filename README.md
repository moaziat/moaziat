Folks, 
I'm on the path to be a neural networks ninja (Andrej Karpathy's path), building things from scratch.
I have experiences with numerical schemes, numerical solvers for physics simulations.
Python, Julia, Linux & some fortran for fun.

Wait for the NebulArakawa project release in the next two months, introducing a new way to numerically simulate domains in cylindrical geometries!! It's fire.
